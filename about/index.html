        <p>I have been working with web technologies for ten years, and have been involved in all aspects of the software development lifecycle - sales, design, development, production, project management, team management, and product retirement.</p>

<p>What interests me most about current technolgy is its abilty to automate away drudgery, discover new knowledge from large bodies of data, and connect people together to innovate and improve.</p>

<p>It strikes me that the internet itself is the basis upon which humainity becomes self-aware as a whole, adn it is this idea which drives me to participate in a movement towards something greater than the status quo.</p>

<p>The challenge I see, however, is how to take all this benefit without risking the livelyhood of greate swathes of humanity: technologiy&rsquo;s great benefits, given at ever reduced costs, must be balenced against the need to provide people with a meaningful role in a new society.</p>

<p>And it is this challenge that I most enjoy engageing with in my career.</p>

<p>I live in Bristol, and enjoy yoga, woodwork and reading.</p>
