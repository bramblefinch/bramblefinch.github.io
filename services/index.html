<p>I help make things better. This can be your product, the service you offer, or the way you go about doing what you do.</p>

<p>This improvement will likely mean changing the way you work, the way you communicate as a team, or even the technology you use.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-do-this">How do I do this?</h2>

<p>I encourage the use of open-source technology, and show people how it can improve both the quality of their work and the efficiency of how they go about it. I also show how you can gain further benefit by &lsquo;passing on the payment&rsquo; and contributing to open source projects. I can then help recover the cost of this.</p>

<p>I demonstrate how adopting an Agile methodology can be used to manage risk of wasted effort, develop a more efficient team or workflow, and ultimately make you better at what you do.</p>

<h2 id="who-do-i-work-with-to-get-this-done">Who do I work with to get this done?</h2>

<p>I work at any level within an organisation.</p>

<p>For decision makers, this means education about modern software development and use so they can quickly make better, more informed decisions.</p>

<p>For a team of developers, designers, project managers and salespeople, I implement ways to use the software development process as a de-facto tool for better, clearer, and more risk-free communication. This brings immediate benefit to the product or service under offer, and with it a greater internal organisational efficiency.</p>
